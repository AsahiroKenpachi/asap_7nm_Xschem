# SIMULATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF FINFET CIRCUITS USING ASAP - 7nm TECHNOLOGY [EDA - XSCHEM AND NGSPICE]
### what is xschem ?
<p>Xschem is a schematic capture program primarily used for designing and simulating electronic circuits. 
It provides a graphical interface for drawing circuit schematics and integrates with various simulation tools, 
  particularly SPICE simulators, to analyze circuit behavior. </p>

### Xschem Installation for Ubuntu 22.04
<p> Open Your Terminal using ctrl+alt+t in your ubuntu workstation and execute the following command one by one or copy them into a script and run the script using the terminal. </p>

```
#install xschem a schemaic capture tool
git clone https://github.com/StefanSchippers/xschem.git xschem
cd xschem
./configure 
make 
sudo make install 
cd ..
```

### What is Ngspice ?
<p>Ngspice is an open-source mixed-level/mixed-signal electronic circuit simulator based on SPICE3f5, a program originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley. It allows for the simulation of analog and digital electronic circuits at the transistor and system levels. Ngspice is widely used for circuit design and verification in both academic and commercial environments due to its flexibility and extensive feature set. </p>
<p>Ngspice offers various features that make it a powerful tool for circuit simulation. It can simulate a wide variety of electronic circuits, from simple resistor-capacitor networks to complex mixed-signal integrated circuits. The simulator supports various types of analyses, including DC, AC, transient, and noise analysis, among others. It includes a comprehensive library of device models, such as diodes, transistors (BJT, MOSFET), and operational amplifiers. One of the strengths of ngspice is its compatibility with other SPICE simulators, allowing it to read and simulate netlists created for other SPICE-based tools.</p><p> Typical use cases for ngspice include analog circuit design, where engineers and hobbyists use it to design and test analog circuits before building physical prototypes. In education, it is widely used to teach electronic circuit design and simulation, providing students with hands-on experience in a virtual environment. Researchers also use ngspice to model and analyze new types of circuits and devices, aiding in the development of innovative technologies.Additionally, users can extend Ngspice with custom scripts and models, enhancing its functionality for specific needs.Ngspice is compatible with many existing SPICE models and netlists, allowing for easy migration from other SPICE-based tools. It is also frequently updated and maintained by a community of developers, ensuring ongoing improvements and support.</p>
<p> For further information the Ngspice documentation is available at https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf</p>

### Ngspice Installation for Ubuntu 22.04
<p> Open Your Terminal using ctrl+alt+t in your ubuntu workstation and execute the following command one by one or copy them into a script and run the script using the terminal. </p>

```
## clone the source repository into a local ngspice_git directory
git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/ngspice/ngspice ngspice_git
cd ngspice_git
mkdir release
./autogen.sh
cd release
## by default if no --prefix is provided ngspice will install under /usr/local/{bin,share,man,lib}
## you can add a --prefix=/home/username to install into your home directory.
../configure --with-x --enable-xspice --disable-debug --enable-cider --with-readline=yes --enable-openmp --enable-osdi
## build the program
make
## install the program and needed files.
sudo make install

```

<p>For Windows and MAC users , installation procedure is available at https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/docs/ngspice-manual.pdf </p>

### What is ASAP-7nm?
<p>ASAP7nm is a process design kit (PDK) developed by the Academia and Semiconductor Industrial Partnership (ASIP) consortium, providing access to advanced semiconductor manufacturing technologies at the 7-nanometer (nm) node. It includes essential files and documentation for designing integrated circuits (ICs) with increased transistor density, improved performance, and reduced power consumption. Aimed at researchers, educators, and industry partners, ASAP7nm facilitates experimentation, education, and collaboration in semiconductor engineering, enabling innovative IC designs, hands-on learning, and prototyping before commercial production.</p>
<p>Installation of the above PDK can be done by cloning the git repo at https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/asap7</p>

### BSIM - CMG
<p>BSIM-CMG, or Berkeley Short-channel IGFET Model for the Common Multi-Gate Structure, is a compact model for simulating multi-gate transistors, such as FinFETs and nanowire FETs, developed by the Device Model Working Group (DMWG) at the University of California, Berkeley. BSIM-CMG extends the capabilities of traditional BSIM models to accurately model the behavior of advanced multi-gate transistor structures, taking into account complex physical phenomena such as short-channel effects, quantum mechanical effects, and gate coupling. It is widely used in the semiconductor industry and academia for the design and optimization of nanoscale integrated circuits, enabling accurate prediction of device characteristics and performance.</p>

<p>By changing the .pm to .sp as foretold we are trying to use BSIM-CMG model for simulating our inverter. If you wnat to use the latest finfet model use the website https://www.bsim.berkeley.edu/models/bsimcmg/ </p>

<p> These models are written using Verilog-A [extension .va] and are compiled using OpenVAF compiler. Upon Compilation , we will ger .osdi files from .va files . Add it to your working directory where .sp is present. The latest version of Ngspice has the support for .osdi files which may not be true fur older versions. You can get OpenVAF from https://openvaf.semimod.de/docs/getting-started/introduction/  </p>
<p>Make sure that the executable of OpenVAF is in the path of your system so that .va files can be compiled </p>

### How To create symbols For Xschem
<p>Xschem has no predefined pdk target, as long as spice models are available and the netlist syntax for silicon devices is known a library of symbols (fets, bjts, diodes, capacitors, resistors and so on) can be created for that specific pdk. Some artwork is needed to create the symbols, like this:</p>

![unnamed](https://github.com/AsahiroKenpachi/asap_7nm_Xschem/assets/137492506/908e6679-9352-4d8a-a8aa-1ab0067a03c6)

Therefore based on reram.sym of SKY130 , We found out how to integrate spice to create the symbol. The only thing that the user must do is change this line in .sym file 

```
.control
pre_osdi /home/hprcse/Documents/test/bsimcmg.osdi
.endc
```
To

```
.control
pre_osdi <TO THE ABSOLUTE PATH WHERE .osdi resides>
.endc
```

<p>The .osdi file is given in this git repo which can be cloned in the user's workstation. If possible this file's can be added  to path and using an environment variable it can be mapped during compile time.</p>
